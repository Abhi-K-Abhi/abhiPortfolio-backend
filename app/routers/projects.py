The system utilizes a robust Django-based REST API and WebSockets to synchronize bids across thousands of concurrent users, ensuring sub-second updates and atomic transaction integrity during peak traffic bursts.",

            "High-Concurrency Bidding Logic: Engineered a scalable auction core using Django and Python, managing complex relationships between Buyers, Sellers, and real-time Bids.",
            "Sub-Second State Sync: Integrated WebSockets to provide instant price updates and countdown timers, achieving a seamless 'Live' auction experience for competitive users.",
            "Financial Integrity & Security: Implemented secure transaction logging and JWT-based authentication via Djoser to prevent unauthorized bidding and ensure 100% data auditability.",
            "Optimized API Performance: Developed efficient Serializers and Viewsets that reduced database query overhead, enabling the system to handle heavy bid bursts without latency.",
            "Atomic Database Operations: Applied advanced SQL locking mechanisms to ensure that bid increments are processed sequentially, preventing race conditions in high-speed auctions."
